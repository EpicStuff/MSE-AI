		"abstract": "Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are the future for scientific discovery in a world growing with artificial intelligence. The interaction between scientists and automated instrumentation are leading conversations about the impact of SDLs on research.\n          , \n            Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), implemented through self-driving laboratories (SDLs), are rapidly creating unprecedented opportunities for the accelerated discovery and optimization of materials. This paper provides a joint analysis of SDLs from both academic and industry perspectives, highlighting the importance of integrating human intelligence in these systems. It discusses the necessity of careful planning in SDL design across physical, data, and workflow dimensions, including instrumental setup, experimental workflow, data management, and human–SDL interaction. The significance of integrating human input within SDLs, especially as the focus shifts from individual tools and tasks to the creation and management of complex workflows, is emphasized. The paper stresses on the crucial role of reward function design in developing forward-looking workflows and examines the interplay between hardware evolution, ML application across chemical processes, and the influence of reward systems in research. Ultimately, the article advocates for a future where SDLs blend human intuition in hypothesis formulation with AI's precision, speed, and data-handling capabilities.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n            With the rise of self-driving labs (SDLs) and automated experimentation across chemical and materials sciences, there is a considerable challenge in designing the best autonomous lab for a given problem based on published studies alone. Determining what digital and physical features are germane to a specific study is a critical aspect of SDL design that needs to be approached quantitatively. Even when controlling for features such as dimensionality, every experimental space has unique requirements and challenges that influence the design of the optimal physical platform and algorithm. Metrics such as optimization rate are therefore not necessarily indicative of the capabilities of an SDL across different studies. In this perspective, we highlight some of the critical metrics for quantifying performance in SDLs to better guide researchers in implementing the most suitable strategies. We then provide a brief review of the existing literature under the lens of quantified performance as well as heuristic recommendations for platform and experimental space pairings.",

		"abstract": "With the advent of self-driving labs promising to synthesize large numbers of new materials, new automated tools are required for checking potential duplicates in existing structural databases before a material can be claimed as novel. To avoid duplication, we rigorously define the novelty metric of any periodic material as the smallest distance to its nearest neighbor among already known materials.  Using ultra-fast structural invariants, all such nearest neighbors can be found within seconds on a typical computer even if a given crystal is disguised by changing a unit cell, perturbing atoms, or replacing chemical elements. This real-time novelty check is demonstrated by finding near-duplicates of the 43 materials produced by Berkeley’s A-lab in the world’s largest collections of inorganic structures, the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Project.  To help future self-driving labs successfully identify novel materials, we propose navigation maps of the materials space where any new structure can be quickly located by its invariant descriptors similar to a geographic location on Earth.

		"abstract": "Recent development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has propelled their application in scientific discovery, but the validation and exploration of these discoveries require subsequent empirical experimentation. The concept of self-driving laboratories promises to automate and thus boost the experimental process following AI-driven discoveries. However, the transition of experimental protocols, originally crafted for human comprehension, into formats interpretable by machines presents significant challenges, which, within the context of specific expert domain, encompass the necessity for structured as opposed to natural language, the imperative for explicit rather than tacit knowledge, and the preservation of causality and consistency throughout protocol steps. Presently, the task of protocol translation predominantly requires the manual and labor-intensive involvement of domain experts and information technology specialists, rendering the process time-intensive. To address these issues, we propose a framework that automates the protocol translation process through a three-stage workflow, which incrementally constructs Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that approach structured on the syntax level, completed on the semantics level, and linked on the execution level. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have demonstrated its performance at par with that of human experts, underscoring its potential to significantly expedite and democratize the process of scientific discovery by elevating the automation capabilities within self-driving laboratories.",

We introduce an innovative approach to the temporal characterisation of materials. The article discusses the challenges posed by manual methods involving established laboratory equipment and presents an automated hyperspectral characterisation station. This station integrates robot-aided hyperspectral imaging, complex material characterisation modeling, and automated data analysis, offering a non-destructive and comprehensive approach. This work explains how the proposed assembly can automatically measure the half-life of biodegradable polymers with higher throughput and accuracy than manual methods. The investigation explores the effect of pH, number of average molecular weight (Mn), end groups, and blends on the degradation rate of polylactic acid (PLA). The contributions of the paper lie in introducing an adaptable classification station for novel characterisation methods and presenting an innovative methodology for polymer degradation rate measurement. The proposed system has the potential to accelerate the development of high-throughput screening and characterisation methods in material and chemistry laboratories.",

Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these difficulties, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, BM LPactive, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to subsymbolic methods, BM LPactive encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, BM LPactive can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with 90% fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. BM LPactive enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.",

Solution-based coatings are typically less expensive to produce than vacuum-based coatings; however, it is generally more difﬁcult to produce high-quality coatings using solution-based methods due to lower control over the physical and chemical processes involved. Here, we show how a selfdriving laboratory can be used to optimize spray coating parameters. For this demonstration, we optimized the combustion synthesis of spray-cast conductive palladium (Pd) ﬁlms. The closed-loop optimization yielded ﬁlms with conductivities of >4 MS/m, which compares favorably with the conductivities of 2–6 MS/m reported for thin Pd ﬁlms obtained by vacuum-based sputtering processes. The champion coating conditions were scaled up to an 83 larger area using the same spray-coating apparatus while preserving coating quality and conductivity. This work shows how self-driving laboratories can optimize solution-based coatings at scale.",

This platform uses computations, historical data from the literature, machine learning (ML) and active learning to plan and interpret the outcomes of experiments performed using robotics. Over 17 days of continuous operation, the A-Lab realized 41 novel compounds from a set of 58 targets including a variety of oxides and phosphates that were identified using large-scale ab initio phase-stability data from the Materials Project and Google DeepMind. Synthesis recipes were proposed by natural-language models trained on the literature and optimized using an active-learning approach grounded in thermodynamics. Analysis of the failed syntheses provides direct and actionable suggestions to improve current techniques for materials screening and synthesis design. The high success rate demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-driven platforms for autonomous materials discovery and motivates further integration of computations, historical knowledge and robotics.",

Herein, we review recent progress in the design of self-driving laboratories, including robotics to automate materials synthesis and characterization, in conjunction with AI to interpret experimental outcomes and propose new experimental procedures. We focus on efforts to automate inorganic synthesis through solution-based routes, solid-state reactions, and thin film deposition. In each case, connections are made to relevant work in organic chemistry, where automation is more common. Characterization techniques are primarily discussed in the context of phase identification, as this task is critical to understand what products have formed during synthesis. The application of deep learning to analyze multivariate characterization data and perform phase identification is examined. To achieve “closed-loop” materials synthesis and design, we further provide a detailed overview of optimization algorithms that use active learning to rationally guide experimental iterations. Finally, we highlight several key opportunities and challenges for the future development of self-driving inorganic materials synthesis platforms.",

However, the process is time-consuming and often requires extensive literature reviews and numerous experiments. Our study addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to analyze material properties with greater precision and efficiency. By automating the data extraction process and using the extracted information to train machine learning models, our developed model, SciQu, optimizes material properties. As a proof of concept, we predicted the refractive index of materials using data extracted from numerous research articles with SciQu, considering input descriptors such as space group, volume, and bandgap with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ∼ 0.068 and R2 ∼ 0.94. Thus, SciQu not only predicts the material’s properties but also plays a key role in self-driving laboratories by optimizing the synthesis parameters to achieve precise shape, size, and phase of the materials subjected to the input parameters.",

However, synthetic route exploration and development of the highest‐performing QDs for device applications remain challenging. In this work, Smart Dope is presented, which is a self‐driving fluidic lab (SDFL), for the accelerated synthesis space exploration and autonomous optimization of LHP QDs. Specifically, the multi‐cation doping of CsPbCl\n              3\n              QDs using a one‐pot high‐temperature synthesis chemistry is reported. Smart Dope continuously synthesizes multi‐cation‐doped CsPbCl\n              3\n              QDs using a high‐pressure gas‐liquid segmented flow format to enable continuous experimentation with minimal experimental noise at reaction temperatures up to 255°C. Smart Dope offers multiple functionalities, including accelerated mechanistic studies through digital twin QD synthesis modeling, closed‐loop autonomous optimization for accelerated QD synthetic route discovery, and on‐demand continuous manufacturing of high‐performing QDs. Through these developments, Smart Dope autonomously identifies the optimal synthetic route of Mn‐Yb co‐doped CsPbCl\n              3\n              QDs with a PLQY of 158%, which is the highest reported value for this class of QDs to date. Smart Dope illustrates the power of SDFLs in accelerating the discovery and development of emerging advanced energy materials.",

From traditional approaches to modern-day advancements, the integration of automation and artificial intelligence (AI)-guided decision-making has emerged as a transformative route in shaping new research methodologies.

In this Perspective, we examine the potential of SDLs in driving sustainability forward through case studies in materials discovery and process optimization, thereby paving the way for a greener and more efficient future.

Frugal twins range from simple toy examples to low-cost surrogates of high-cost research systems. For example, a color-mixing self-driving laboratory (SDL) can serve as a low-cost version of a costly multi-step chemical discovery SDL. Frugal twins already provide hands-on experience for SDLs with low costs and low risks. They can also offer as test beds for software prototyping (\n              e.g.\n              , optimization, data infrastructure), and a low barrier to entry for democratizing SDLs. However, there is room for improvement. The true value of frugal twins can be realized in three core areas. Firstly, hardware and software modularity; secondly, purpose-built design (human-inspired\n              vs.\n              hardware-centric\n              vs.\n              human-in-the-loop); and thirdly state-of-the-art (SOTA) software (\n              e.g.\n              , multi-fidelity optimization). We also describe the ethical benefits and risks that come with the democratization of science through frugal twins. For future work, we suggest ideas for new frugal twins, SDL educational course outcomes, and a classification scheme for autonomy levels.",

		"abstract": "CONSPECTUS: We must accelerate the pace at which we make technological advancements to address climate change and disease risks worldwide. This swifter pace of discovery requires faster research and development cycles enabled by better integration between hypothesis generation, design, experimentation, and data analysis. Typical research cycles take months to years. However, data-driven automated laboratories, or self-driving laboratories, can significantly accelerate molecular and materials discovery. Recently, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of machine learning and optimization algorithms that have allowed researchers to extract valuable knowledge from multidimensional data sets. Machine learning models can be trained on large data sets from the literature or databases, but their performance can often be hampered by a lack of negative results or metadata. In contrast, data generated by self-driving laboratories can be information-rich, containing precise details of the experimental conditions and metadata. Consequently, much larger amounts of high-quality data are gathered in self-driving laboratories. When placed in open repositories, this data can be used by the research community to reproduce experiments, for more in-depth analysis, or as the basis for further investigation. Accordingly, high-quality open data sets will increase the accessibility and reproducibility of science, which is sorely needed. In this Account, we describe our efforts to build a self-driving lab for the development of a new class of materials: organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs). Since they have only recently been demonstrated, little is known about the molecular and material design rules for thin-film, electrically-pumped OSL devices as compared to other technologies such as organic light-emitting diodes or organic photovoltaics. To realize high-performing OSL materials, we are developing a flexible system for automated synthesis via iterative Suzuki−Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. This automated synthesis platform is directly coupled to the analysis and purification capabilities. Subsequently, the molecules of interest can be transferred to an optical characterization setup. We are currently limited to optical measurements of the OSL molecules in solution. However, material properties are ultimately most important in the solid state (e.g., as a thin-film device). To that end and for a different scientific goal, we are developing a self-driving lab for inorganic thin-film materials focused on the oxygen evolution reaction. While the future of self-driving laboratories is very promising, numerous challenges still need to be overcome. These challenges can be split into cognition and motor function. Generally, the cognitive challenges are related to optimization with constraints or unexpected outcomes for which general algorithmic solutions have yet to be developed. A more practical challenge that could be resolved in the near future is that of software control and integration because few instrument manufacturers design their products with self-driving laboratories in mind. Challenges in motor function are largely related to handling heterogeneous systems, such as dispensing solids or performing extractions. As a result, it is critical to understand that adapting experimental procedures that were designed for human experimenters is not as simple as transferring those same actions to an automated system, and there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same goal in an automated fashion. Accordingly, for self-driving laboratories, we need to carefully rethink the translation of manual experimental protocols.",

		"abstract": "The rapid emergence of large language model (LLM) technology presents promising opportunities to facilitate the development of synthetic reactions. In this work, we leveraged the power of GPT-4 to build an LLM-based reaction development framework (LLM-RDF) to handle fundamental tasks involved throughout the chemical synthesis development. LLM-RDF comprises six specialized LLM-based agents, including Literature Scouter, Experiment Designer, Hardware Executor, Spectrum Analyzer, Separation Instructor, and Result Interpreter, which are pre-prompted to accomplish the designated tasks. A web application with LLM-RDF as the backend was built to allow chemist users to interact with automated experimental platforms and analyze results via natural language, thus, eliminating the need for coding skills and ensuring accessibility for all chemists. We demonstrated the capabilities of LLM-RDF in guiding the end-to-end synthesis development process for the copper/TEMPO catalyzed aerobic alcohol oxidation to aldehyde reaction, including literature search and information extraction, substrate scope and condition screening, reaction kinetics study, reaction condition optimization, reaction scale-up and product purification. Furthermore, LLM-RDF’s broader applicability and versability was validated on various synthesis tasks of three distinct reactions (SNAr reaction, photoredox C-C cross-coupling reaction, and heterogeneous photoelectrochemical reaction).",
