Research Acceleration in Self-Driving Labs: Technological
Roadmap toward Accelerated Materials and Molecular
Discovery
Fernando Delgado-Licona and Milad Abolhasani*
1. Introduction
Exponential growth is characterized by improvements in a key
aspect of a process or device that follows a power law over a ﬁxed
time interval. The most famous example is Moore ’s Law stating
that the number of transistors within an integrated circuit will
double every 2 years.[1]A similar acceleration has been extended
to other ﬁelds (accelerated returns),[2]for instance, the number of
parameters of neural network models,[3]the Taniguchi chart for
maximum achievable machining accuracy,[4]and the Carlson
curve in biotechnology.[5]There is a growing expectation that
advanced materials and specialty/ ﬁne chemicals will soon expe-
rience an exponential acceleration in their pace of discovery andsustainable manufacturing. This promise
has been fueled by the recent integra-
tion of rapidly emerging technologies,
including robotics,[6,7]advanced
manufacturing,[8–10]and data science[11–15]
with chemical and materials sciences.
Global challenges that require our
immediate attention, such as climate
change and rapidly rising energy demands,
further amplify the need for research accel-
eration in chemical and materials sciences.
The need to fast-track ﬁnding a solution to
a global problem presented itself during
the discovery and manufacturing of the vac-
cine against the COVID-19 virus, which,
among other mitigating efforts, became a
priority to restore normality and decrease
global mortality rates.[16]Hence, time-to-
solution is a critical measure to assess
damages that global challenges could incur
on society, the environment, and the global
economy. To achieve the shortest time-to-solution, research
acceleration is imperative. Despite the challenges, in the case
of COVID-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry was able
to accelerate vaccine research by 4X, when compared to the fast-
est vaccine discovery effort to date,[17]thanks to a strong techno-
logical infrastructure (e.g., DNA sequencing, mRNA technology,
bio-manufacturing) and an impressive global collaboration.[16,17]
To achieve the targeted 1.5 –2 °C average global temperature
rise by the year 2100[18]and avoid the impending catastrophic
consequences in the near future, we need a similar global
collaboration using an accelerated research infrastructure.
Beyond policy agreements and international pledges, high-
performing functional materials with cost-effective and energy
efﬁcient devices are needed as a gateway to a carbon-neutral
future.[19]For example, grid decarbonization requires new
high-performing clean energy materials and sustainable
processes for affordable and scalable renewable energy
applications.[20]
Accelerated materials and molecular discovery (AMMD)
promises 10 –100X reduction of energy and chemical consump-
tion, processing time, risk of operation, and capital investment
within a typical discovery cycle that involves 1) speci ﬁcation of a
research question, 2) automated collection of relevant existing
data, 3) formation of a hypothesis, 4) autonomous (closed-loop)
experimentation and testing of hypothesis, and 5) communica-
tion of results and generated knowledge.[21]Confronted with
the most decisive environmental crisis in recent years, climateF. Delgado-Licona, M. Abolhasani

DOI: 10.1002/aisy.202200331The urgency of ﬁnding solutions to global energy, sustainability, and healthcare
challenges has motivated rethinking of the conventional chemistry and material
science work ﬂows. Self-driving labs, emerged through integration of disruptive
physical and digital technologies, including robotics, additive manufacturing,
reaction miniaturization, and arti ﬁcial intelligence, have the potential to accel-
erate the pace of materials and molecular discovery by 10 –100X. Using auton-
omous robotic experimentation work ﬂows, self-driving labs enable access to a
larger part of the chemical universe and reduce the time-to-solution through an
iterative hypothesis formulation, intelligent experiment selection, and automated
testing. By providing a data-centric abstraction to the accelerated discovery cycle,
in this perspective article, the required hardware and software technological
infrastructure to unlock the true potential of self-driving labs is discussed. In
particular, process intensi ﬁcation as an accelerator mechanism for reaction
modules of self-driving labs and digitalization strategies to further accelerate the
discovery cycle in chemical and materials sciences are discussed.PERSPECTIVE

worldwide.[22]Accelerated materials discovery could also contrib-
ute to addressing worldwide environmental concerns such as
resource scarcity and plastic pollution, by rethinking materials
management, conventional chemical processing, and linear
production paradigms.
Research acceleration in chemical and materials sciences has
been recognized as an emerging ﬁeld in the past 5 years.[23–25]
Research acceleration is achieved through the use of arti ﬁcial
intelligence (AI), robotics, lab automation, and parallel batch
orﬂow reactors in a closed-loop format.[26,27]The resulting
closed-loop platform which enables accelerated experimentation
and hypothesis testing is called a “self-driving lab (SDL). ”SDLs
involve streamlined and autonomous robotic experimentation
using an integrated experimental work ﬂow, operated continu-
ously with faster time-to-solution when compared to a human
researcher in a conventional chemistry and materials science
research setting ( Figure 1 ).[23,28]Two aspects of automation in
the research acceleration by SDLs include 1) automation of
experiments (physical unit operations and characterization units)
and 2) automation of experiment –selection process (with the
help of machine-learning algorithms). Physical automation of
experiments using the same existing hardware found in conven-
tional experimental work ﬂows in chemical and material sciences
(e.g., using a robotic arm instead of a human scientist to perform
different experimental tasks) could effectively reduce experimen-
tation time by at least 2X. Such automation translates to a 2X
increase in the data-generation throughput compared to manual
experimentation, furthermore, it allows the highly trained scien-
tist to focus on other discovery steps, such as formulating
research inquiries and hypothesis. While process automation
and combinatorial screening provide reproducibility, process
standardization, cost reduction, and parallelization capabilities,
it has been argued that automation alone is not suf ﬁcient to sup-
port AMMD at a pace required to address the global chal-
lenges.[29]Relying solely on physical automation provides no
ﬂexibility for the system to adapt to unexpected process condi-
tions, therefore, all preparations should be performed prior to
the start of automated experiments by the expert scientist.
However, SDLs, by integrating physical and digital lab automa-
tion, provide a framework for the development of synchronous,
interoperable, and standard autonomous systems that could facil-
itate common processing tasks —error and exception handling,
fault corrections, cleaning protocols, failure, and anomaly detec-
tion—by removing the necessity of “hardcoding ”precise actionsequences, and allowing the SDL learn these and other related
tasks in an autonomous fashion, with reduced human interven-
tion before, during, and after an experiment is performed.
Consequently, SDLs are coupled with advanced AI strategies,
such as active learning, to provide an additional 5 –20X accelera-
tion factor in addition to the 2X obtained by physical automation
in chemical and materials sciences by intelligently navigating the
exponentially increasing reaction and processing parameter
spaces, avoiding exhaustive combinatorial searches, integrating
cleaning, failure, error, and exception protocols, while signi ﬁ-
cantly reducing reagent consumption.[30,31]For instance,
Burger et al. reported an autonomous mobile robot performing
photocatalyst optimization with 1000X faster throughput com-
pared to manual methods, and 10X when compared to semiau-
tomated work ﬂows.[32]
It should also be noted that optimizing the automation process
for both the physical and digital aspects of SDLs is crucial to
reduce the recon ﬁguration time needed for exploring a new class
of materials/molecules by the same SDL. Such optimization
involves approaching automation from modular and ﬂexible per-
spectives. Currently, it takes 3 –5 years to build a reliable SDL for
complex chemistries, and an additional 1 –2 years to upgrade an
SDL for another class of materials/molecules. This long deve-
lopment timeframe of SDLs and their high cost are considered
as two of the most important SDL entry barriers for researchers.
Early proof-of-concept demonstrations of SDLs in chemical
and materials sciences have been successful in illustrating the
research acceleration by employing closed-loop autonomous
experimentation strategies enabled by integration of automated
experimentation and automated experiment-selection.[33,34]
While most of the focus in the emerging ﬁeld of SDLs has been
centered around robotic automation and AI, to have a better
understanding of the evolution and potential of AMMD, it is
important to understand its core technologies. Innovation and
synergy over a range of technologies usually coincide with sys-
tem-wide improvements and subsequent exponential break-
throughs.[35]Thus, a true research acceleration in chemical
and materials sciences could only be achieved when the techno-
logical infrastructure to support the ﬁve iterative discovery steps
are developed synergistically.
Understanding the technological infrastructure that powers
AMMD efforts will offer a valuable perspective toward building
an ideal SDL for accelerating ﬁnding solutions to global chal-
lenges in energy, sustainability, and healthcare. With this goal,
in this perspective article, we discuss AMMD by using SDLs and

their role to facilitate data ﬂow and processes, ultimately guiding
the current technological infrastructure that we believe realizes
these processes at each discovery step. We highlight the advan-
tages and limitations of each core technology of SDLs and detail
their larger role in academic and industrial research settings. We
then discuss a roadmap to the realization of an accelerated SDL
through the integration of the discussed technologies.
2. AMMD: Technological Infrastructure
Data processes are the foundation of AMMD. When the discov-
ery cycle is analyzed under this abstraction, the technological
roadmap toward continuous improvements becomes evident.
A summary of the data processes for each discovery step is
summarized in Table 1 .
Every piece of hardware and software that facilitates the tasks
listed in Table 1 belongs to the technological infrastructure that
has the potential to complement human knowledge and intui-
tion, thus, accelerating the pace and throughput of research
efforts in chemical and materials sciences. Furthermore, strate-
gies that strengthen the interconnection and data ﬂow between
two or more steps of the discovery cycle, a process described
earlier as “closing the loop, ”increase the acceleration factor in
discovering new materials and molecules. Self-driving labs play
a central role in AMMD; they function as the bridge between bits
and atoms, from software and data to hardware and materials.
Over the past 5 years, SDLs have successfully demonstrated
the bene ﬁt of closing the loop between hypothesis formation
and autonomous experimentation.[36,37]The closed-loop experi-
mentation has been possible thanks to the coordination of
software and hardware technologies contributing to the afore-
mentioned data processes ( Figure 2 ). For example, most of
the hypothesis formulations performed autonomously by
SDLs consist of suggesting new parameters for testing by the
experimental modules of the SDLs. In human language, the
formulated hypothesis might take the form of “Does parameter
xgenerate the target material with the highest discovered char-
acteristic a?”. Such hypotheses are automatically generated by
data-driven predictive models trained and built using previous
data generated by the SDL, followed by proposing new experi-
ments given the best-predicted outcome to test and thus validate
or invalidate the generated hypothesis in an iterative manner.[33]Technologies that contribute to data-generation processes
related to AMMD could be divided into 1) reactive strategies
and 2) in silico strategies. In silico strategies are experiments that
develop virtually using any computation machine, for example,
digital computers.[38]Quantum chemistry simulations offer
highly accurate models; however, even moderate-sized molecules
(100 electrons) surpass current digital computational resources
rendering them infeasible to compute.[39]To circumvent these
limitations, other computational strategies have been developed,
most noticeably AI methods, for example, by introducing graph-
based neural network architectures, Qiao et al. have predicted
energy solutions to the Schrödinger equation matching the
accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) while reducing the
computational cost by 1000X.[40]Technologies surrounding in
silico experimentation continue to advance by providing
computationally affordable algorithms for molecule generation
such as generative-adversarial-, transformer-, and diffusion-
based models[41–43]or by developing innovative ways to perform
computations such as analog and quantum computers.[44,45]A
thorough review of other strategies that aim to intensify time-
to-solution in this context can be found elsewhere.[46,47]
Intensi ﬁcation of data processes is expected to result in sus-
tained research acceleration in chemical and materials sciences
using SDLs. While operating in a completely digital world would
offer enhanced acceleration, materializing such discoveries
would imply having SDLs that provide precise control over the
required chemical environment, while being reliable, reproduc-
ible,ﬂexible, and universal. Ultimately, AMMD is a framework to
solve physical worldwide problems (and beyond, e.g., outer
space).[48]Thus, most state-of-the-art SDLs have bypassed the
feasibility challenge of translating digital results into measurable
physical data, through iterating over an automated experimental
platform. In the context of reactive systems, the reaction module
of SDLs could be considered their most important component due
to its role in generating the data required for AMMD. SDLs have
access to the technological infrastructure that allows for intensi ﬁ-
cation of their data-generation processes similar to in silico strate-
gies, but with the added physicality constraints such as material
scarcity and toxic or harmful side products. The leading strategy
to intensify the data-generation process of the reaction modules of
SDLs is called process intensi ﬁcation (PI). We believe that PI is a
core enabler for AMMD efforts, however, a formal rethinking of
its fundamental approaches to better ﬁt subsequent data processes
is required. In the following subsection, we introduce PI and
discuss how it can enhance research productivity of SDLs.
2.1. Process Intensi ﬁcation
PI is de ﬁned as disruptive methods that drastically improve how
chemicals are produced in terms of processing time, energy,
material consumption, and waste generation as well as
environmental and operational safety. PI strategies consist of
four principles 1) maximizing the effectiveness of inter-, and
intramolecular events; 2) providing homogeneous physical and
chemical environment; 3) optimizing the driving forces of the
process and enhancing the speci ﬁc surface area; and 4) maximiz-
ing the synergy of unit operations.[49]When implemented collec-
tively, the resulting intensi ﬁed reaction module of SDLs becomesTable 1. Data processes of each discovery step.

modeling and decision-making steps. The four principles of
PI have been successfully demonstrated in isolation (i.e., onlyfor a reactive process without closing the loop) using various fun-
damental approaches (structure, energy, time, synergy) at the
molecular-, meso-, and macro-scales.[49]

The best-known instance for intensifying a reactive system
through the “structure ”approach is miniaturization. Milli- and
micro- ﬂuidic reactors bene ﬁt from superior heat, mass, and pho-
ton transfer rates, due to enhanced surface-to-volume ratios
when compared to conventional batch reactors with 10 –100X
larger characteristic length scales. Such enhanced transport rates
inﬂow reactors are extremely bene ﬁcial for AMMD applications,
by converging the relevant reactions to their true kinetics (via
removing mass, heat, or photon transfer rate limitations), further
closing the gap toward an optimal data-generation scheme for
SDLs. However, given the reduced characteristic length scale
ofﬂow reactors ( <1 mm), they are prone to fouling and clogging
when handling solids.[50]Small-scale ﬂuid transport is domi-
nated by interfacial and viscous forces (instead of inertial and
gravitational forces), leading to possible long diffusion times
and unwanted Taylor dispersion. To reduce such challenges
in small-scale ﬂow reactors, various reaction miniaturization
implementations have integrated strategies such as multiphase
ﬂow,[51]static micromixers,[52]and intensi ﬁed reactor designs
including Taylor –Couette,[53]spinning disk reactor,[54]cascade
of continuous miniaturized stirred tank reactors,[55]among
others,[56]to enhance the performance of the reactive modules
up to 100X in terms of chemical consumption and total process-
ing time when compared to batch reactors.
It is important to note that gravitational forces start to become
negligible as reactor channels become smaller than 1 mm in
micro ﬂuidic devices.[51]Thus, micro ﬂuidic systems have been
promoted as a prime tool for engineering complex space and exo-
planetary reactive systems,[57]further supporting PI as a prom-
ising framework for the development of universal reactive
modules for SDLs. Further intensi ﬁcation in the spatial domain
(structure approach) could maximize the effectiveness of molec-
ular events by providing a homogenous physical and chemical
environment in the reactive modules of SDLs. For example,
the interplay between microreactor geometry and its resulting
hydrodynamic pro ﬁle has been identi ﬁed as a key parameter
for tuning nanoparticle size, morphology, and composition
distributions.[58]
The experimental acceleration involves two strategies: 1) per-
forming multiple experiments simultaneously (parallelization),
or 2) performing experiments in a shorter amount of time than
the conventional experiments by kinetic acceleration enabled via
reaction and reactor engineering. Miniaturized and parallelized
material synthesis strategies fall under the ﬁrst category, while
reaction intensi ﬁcation through enhanced heat and mass trans-
fer rates of ﬂow reactors fall under the second category of exper-
imental intensi ﬁcation strategies. Beyond ﬂuidic devices,
miniaturization has accelerated the fabrication and exploration
of solid-state materials for electronic devices, that is, semicon-
ductors, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic materials, through
high-throughput experiments, and combinatorial synthesis in
small areas ( <1m m2).[59]Similar miniaturization concept has
also been utilized for co-deposition of multinary thin ﬁlms,
where uniform nanoscale reactor volumes were formed to lever-
age fast reactions due to small diffusion length scales.[60]
Intensi ﬁcation of reactive systems for sustainable chemical syn-
thesis has taken advantage of the rest of the fundamental PI
approaches. For example, localized and uniform photon trans-
port has intensi ﬁed the photo-induced production of organiccompounds and nanoparticles up to 100X when compared to
conventional batch reactors.[61,62]The energy approach to PI
has accelerated other processes in material sciences by precisely
and optimally delivering electric, magnetic (e.g., microwaves),
acoustic (e.g., ultrasound), and gravitational ﬁelds.[63]For exam-
ple, ternary alloy thin- ﬁlm materials have been successfully syn-
thesized using pulsed laser deposition, by precisely targeting the
laser position at the surface of the thin ﬁlm.[64]Similarly, a reac-
tive system can be intensi ﬁed by manipulating the time scales at
which different processes occur. These timescale reductions are
not limited to the already introduced shortening of mixing times
or highly precise temperature –time pro ﬁle tuning in multistage
syntheses,[65]but include pulsations (periodicity) and the para-
digm of shifting processes from batch to continuous ﬂow. An
intensi ﬁed continuous process has the potential to minimize
reactor down times, regularly associated with batch reactions
(e.g., reactor start-up, shut down, and cleaning times) further
accelerating the experiment process by 2 –3X, while providing
the possibility of an uninterrupted stream of reliable and repro-
ducible data if integrated with high-throughput characterization
techniques for subsequent steps of the AMMD cycle.
2.2. Process Intensi ﬁcation for AMMD
The successful demonstration of PI strategies for different
reactive systems illustrates the role of reactor and reaction engi-
neering in future SDLs. Correct implementation of PI strategies
in the reaction module of SDLs could lead to an additional 100X
research acceleration factor for AMMD efforts. Thus, data-
generation acceleration could be considered as another
fundamental approach to PI strategies. Such implementation
would eliminate the missing link between PI and subsequent
data-processing steps underlying AMMD efforts enabled by
SDLs. Similar to other PI strategies, the new fundamental
approach to PI should be capable of ful ﬁlling and realizing all
aforementioned PI principles.
Lopez-Guajardo et al. proposed a ﬁfth approach for process
intensi ﬁcation: data, that corresponds to the Knowledge
domain.[66]This approach explicitly frames PI as a data-
generation process, meaning that the reaction module of
SDLs should extend its data-generation capabilities beyond
carrying out an intensi ﬁed reaction by facilitating in situ or
online characterizations techniques and providing self-describ-
ing data of the network of intensi ﬁed reaction modules used
in the SDLs. Examples of such intensi ﬁed process descriptors
include reactor design/geometry, material, time- and space-
resolved process parameters, classi ﬁcation, and graph represen-
tation that could later augment a data-driven representation of
the system (digital twin).[66]Furthermore, the described data
approach establishes the principles that the generated
data should hold, including well-documented Industry 4.0 data
principles.[67]
In situ or online product characterization provides an inherent
acceleration factor as described earlier due to the self-
optimization capability of SDLs. However, it is not reasonable
to assert that intensi ﬁcation of reaction modules is attained only
through in situ or online product characterization, due to lack of
improvement over the four principles of PI. The realization of

research intensi ﬁcation in SDLs through the data approach
occurs when there is an enhancement of the reaction module
or network of modules, through any synergistic combination
of the PI approaches described earlier (e.g., restructuring the
reactor geometry, choosing a better-suited intensi ﬁed reactor,
introducing an energy ﬁeld). This process could be de ﬁned
as self-intensi ﬁcation, which in combination with the self-
optimization capability, could have a compounding effect to
achieve an exponential improvement of SDLs.[68]
We extend the importance of the data-based PI approach in
SDLs by contextualizing it with further steps in the AMMD cycle
and identifying it as a key complement for the digitalization
strategy that has the potential to close the loop over the entire
set of data processes described in Table 1.
3. Data-Centric AMMD
By effectively closing the loop between hypothesis formulation
and testing, promising research acceleration factors have
been achieved in both academia and industrial set-
tings.[10,22,28,29,32,33,36]However, some of these advancements
are being perceived as dif ﬁcult and expensive to adopt, thereby
challenging the goals of AMMD. Commercial SDLs often employ
a user-friendly software to control their hardware composed of
multiple robots for handling starting reactants and sample trans-
fer, high-precision sensors, a single or parallel batch reactors,
and online sampling modules for automated product characteri-
zation.[69,70]Apart from the out-of-reach adoption costs for most
researchers, such ﬁxed ecosystems with proprietary software and
hardware limit the ﬂexibility and adaptability to existing work ﬂow
architectures in chemistry and materials science labs.[71]
While initial efforts revolving SDLs in academia were focused
on using only modular, off-the-shelf[72]or digitally fabricated
hardware[73]with open-source software (e.g., Python),[74]repro-
ducibility issues proved to be a key challenge. Such issues arise
from the lack of effective data recording and communication sur-
rounding the different physical and chemical environments of
the reaction modules in such custom-built SDLs.[8]By utilizing
modular 3D-printed reactionwares, it has been demonstrated
that digitizing and communicating unit operations such as stir-
ring, temperature pro ﬁle,ﬁltering, and sample transfer can help
to close the lab-to-lab reproducibility gap in organic reactions.[8]
Digitalization of chemical processes could be improved by
employing intensi ﬁed reaction modules. Intensi ﬁed reactive
modules provide a homogeneous physical and chemical environ-
ment, that maximize inter- and intramolecular events, driving
forces, and synergy between unit operations. Therefore, commu-
nicating intensi ﬁed process descriptors could provide valuable
insights at molecular and meso- and macroscales while increas-
ing the volume, reliability, and variety of data.[75]For example,
synthesis and processing of colloidal nanocrystals, with an exper-
imental space ranging from 105to 1010possible experimental
conditions, are time- and material-intensive tasks, using manual
experimentation and batch reactors. In one example, Abdel-Latif
et al.[76]reported intensi ﬁcation of the synthesis and bandgap
tuning of inorganic metal halide perovskite nanocrystals using
two integrated micro ﬂuidic reactors. In this example, process
intensi ﬁcation was achieved not only by reducing the chemicalconsumption during the synthetic route discovery campaigns,
but also by bypassing the need for an intermediate nanocrystal
washing step after the ﬁrst reaction. An AI-assisted experiment
selection strategy provided another acceleration factor to the
intensi ﬁed experimental platform by reducing the total experi-
mental cost (i.e., the number of experiments to perform) for syn-
thetic route discovery of inorganic metal halide perovskite
nanocrystals. Furthermore, development and integration of in
situ and online characterization techniques (sensors) such as
absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and chroma-
tography, as well as small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering
with automated experimental platforms have been critical
technological infrastructure advancements to enable high-
throughput data generation for SDL. Access to such a large
amount of data generated by in situ characterization tools has
accelerated integration of data science tools with chemical and
materials sciences. Building digital twins of chemical and materi-
als processes is one of the natural evolutions of the integration of
data science tools with automated experimentation strategies
equipped with in situ or online characterization tools. By providing
the metadata of such intensi ﬁed process parameters and descrip-
tors, the generated knowledge is expected to be reproducible and
relevant to build digital twins for fundamental and applied queries.
Data aggregation, standardization, interoperability, and
democratization are captured by the last step in the discovery
cycle, that is communication of results and generated knowledge;
this step precedes all previous data processes and plays a de ﬁning
role for a closed-loop AMMD cycle. We outline the synergistic
interplay between data, machines, and humans for a true
research acceleration enabled by the use of SDLs in Figure 2.
Furthermore, to harness the research acceleration for AMMD
derived from global collaborations, it is necessary to aggregate
data from all possible data sources (data fusion), including
SDLs, and provide a standard for effectively communicating data
to humans and machine collaborators. A recent review on this
topic by Bai et al. details the landscape of current data represen-
tations and exchange protocols that could unite isolated AMMD
efforts.[71]Semantic web technologies are highlighted as a
promising technological infrastructure to achieve a fully
interconnected web, hence, universal interoperability across
scales and domains.[71]
There are two main components in a closed-loop AMMD
cycle, shown in Figure 2: 1) the physical world (Figure 2, bottom
panel) where data generation takes place, and 2) the virtual world
where data processes are interconnected (Figure 2, top panel). It
is important to note that the virtual world, despite being pre-
sented as different levels for clarity, is a single universal entity
similar to a dynamic knowledge graph, where various steps of
the AMMD cycle take place. This framework represents all
aspects of the real world, including an ontological representation
of the physical space and interoperable agents (automated soft-
ware) that are responsible for all data processes (Figure 2I –V).[77]
More generally, this virtual world falls within the technological
infrastructure of digital twins and the encompassing metaverse
technological infrastructure.[78]While some digital twin imple-
mentations consist of building accurate process models for prop-
erty predictions,[34]a thorough implementation should consider
the digital representation of both hardware and software compo-
nents, and a facile control/interaction between them. In one

example, Li et al. presented an integration of various physical and
digital technologies, such as virtual reality, collaborative robots,
and AI to accelerate optimization of the optical properties of
semiconductor nanocrystals.[79]In this example, the various com-
ponents, including the solid and liquid handling robots commu-
nicated through 5 G network, and the generated data was stored
in a structured query language (SQL) database hosted in the
cloud.[79]The key enabling factor of a closed-loop AMMD cycle
is the fully interconnected, interoperable, and distributed net-
work of SDLs. In the case of SDLs following a reactive strategy,
intensi ﬁed process descriptors could mitigate data representa-
tion and interoperability issues that arise when two different
groups share data generated by different reactive platforms.
Since intensi ﬁed process descriptors should in principle capture
a detailed representation of physical and chemical environment,
reproducibility, and most importantly an interoperable data
representation, could evolve from data-based PI.
An interesting aspect of future SDLs is automated research
question formulation that is currently underdeveloped. Graph
representation of potentially missing data in the virtual world
of SDLs could potentially guide the speci ﬁcation of research
questions. Although several proof-of-concept strategies in
graph-based knowledge modeling have demonstrated automated
agents that address inconsistent thermodynamic data and send
requests to perform DFT calculations,[80]such graph representa-
tions could be generalized to agents that guide the attention of
researchers. Another example arises from analyzing relation-
ships among the knowledge graph structures to ﬁnd potentially
new properties or structures of chemicals, therefore, guiding
research efforts.[81]For example, through transfer learning, a
graph neural network accurately predicted conductivity on more
than 104potential candidates of lithium-conducting polymer
electrolytes, narrowing the search of high-performing materials
for energy storage technologies.[82]Building graph representa-
tion of data requires access to large data libraries, which are
usually scattered across multiple databases, from patents and
research articles[83]to personal lab notebooks.[84]Aggregating
such data into useful query-able knowledge graphs could be
achieved by leveraging cloud-based computation resources.
RoboRXN exempli ﬁes this work ﬂow through the orchestration
of different cloud-based technologies that range automated data
collection, automated hypothesis making, and autonomous
experimentation.[1]
4. AMMD: Rede ﬁning the Role of Human in
Experimental Sciences
The presented data processes mark a technological roadmap
toward an AMMD. While a strong technological infrastructure
is imperative for the advancement of research acceleration
efforts, its integration into the existing chemistry and material
science communities will be a crucial factor for its eventual suc-
cess. As it is true for any new framework or technology, its broad
adoption will depend on various factors, including society aware-
ness, identifying tangible bene ﬁts, and having access to a large
enough pool of highly trained workforce with multidisciplinaryskills. We believe that the broad interest to AMMD continues to
grow, as evidenced by various efforts that embrace data-driven
materials development in academia and industrial workforce
by introducing new educational programs.[85]Furthermore, there
is a common perception that AMMD is not bound to replace
human researchers, but to rede ﬁne their role in the entire
discovery cycle, enhancing the discovery capability of researchers
by allowing them to focus on creative and new endeavors within
the chemical universe.
From an emerging technology adoption perspective, imple-
mentation challenges naturally arise for data-intensive research.
This implementation challenge could be analogously studied by
how knowledge diffuses among the academic and industrial
research communities. The leading effort to ensure democrati-
zation of access and communication of molecular and
material data is through Open Data efforts. These data manage-
ment infrastructures follow FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) data principles to facilitate the integra-
tion of various AMMD efforts. For a comprehensive review of
different implementation challenges such as ﬁnancing, owner-
ship, and longevity, we refer the reader to an excellent review
by Himanen et al.[13]We expect that further development in
the technological infrastructure of AMMD will continue to
improve the underlying data processes of each discovery step,
lowering the entry barrier, and thereby facilitating both adoption
and implementation of AMMD strategies. For instance, advances
in blockchain technology could impact transparency, accessibil-
ity, and reliability in SDLs data generation and retrieval.[86]
It is well-known from other exponential technologies that
sustained improvements have physical limits, for example,
Moore ’s Law is expected to no longer follow the doubling trend
after 2025, and thus potential strategies to keep the pace of tech-
nological advancements are already in motion. In the context of
AMMD, we foresee a similar roadblock and draw similarities
between the prototypical strategies, such as creating processes
application speci ﬁc, while keeping the data ﬂows intact.
Another example is rethinking the entire chemistry work ﬂow.
Alternative chemical paradigms such as Circular Chemistry, that
go beyond discovering better materials, can further improve the
goals of minimizing chemical consumption and create a safer
working environment. SDLs can facilitate material ﬂow and life
cycle analysis of emerging advanced materials and molecules by
providing precise (meta) data throughout the overall process.
Furthermore, circularity and sustainability indices, as well as
carbon footprint of different materials and molecular discovery
campaigns, can be readily integrated into the decision-making
process of SDLs to further enhance the overall goals of
AMMD strategies.
In summary, SDLs will not reach their full potential for
AMMD without open science and collaborations within acade-
mia and industry. It is early to decide, for example, what the
correct technological strategies are to attain the shortest time-
to-solution to several worldwide problems. However, we believe
that by providing a data-centric framework for AMMD, the call
could reach a larger audience, and interdisciplinary global
collaboration could be further facilitated.

5. Conclusion
Motivated by the growing expectation that advanced materials
and specialty/ ﬁne chemicals will experience an exponential accel-
eration in their pace of discovery, in this perspective article, we
discussed the otherwise ignored role of chemical engineering, in
particular, reactor and reaction engineering as a fundamental
technological infrastructure for intensifying the research output
of SDLs. We identi ﬁed PI as an enabling factor in elevating
the performance of currently existing SDLs. Speci ﬁcally, we
discussed how treating PI as a data-enabler mechanism of the
reaction modules of SDLs could result in sustained acceleration
of AMMD efforts. We believe the overall technological infrastruc-
tures of SDLs should be reevaluated through the lens of PI to
unleash their full potential for much-needed acceleration of
materials and molecular discovery. 1) We laid a data-centric
framework to identify, address, and advance the hardware and
software strategies in SDLs from an AMMD perspective to
optimally “close the discovery loop ”in chemical and materials
sciences. In addition, we discussed the importance of digitaliza-
tion strategies, speci ﬁcally the representation of intensi ﬁed
reaction modules, in addition to data standardization, data
interoperability, and data democratization as requirements for
AMMD efforts. 2) We envision an ideal and universal SDL
should have access to the prior PI knowledge, such as intensi ﬁed
reactors or processes suited for different chemistries. Such
knowledge can then be leveraged in a digital format to identify
if using certain PI strategies can be applied anywhere in the SDL
workﬂow to further intensify research productivity and sustain-
ability for AMMD. In addition, continuous intensi ﬁcation of dif-
ferent aspects of SDLs will result in a signi ﬁcant reduction of the
environmental impact of AMMD.
